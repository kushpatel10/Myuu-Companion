# **Myuu-Companion**

A Discord bot designed to detect and handle specific PokÃ©mon encounters (e.g., "Shiny" PokÃ©mon or "Greninja-Ash") in messages from a specific bot and log these encounters in designated channels. The bot also provides additional functionality through various slash commands.

# **Whats-New**
- Custom Pokemon Timeout! (Stores the pokemon data in MongoDB)
- Reels downloader (IDK WHY)
- Pokemon Auction commands
- Added MongoDB to store the no. of shinys
- Image leaderboard for the shinys encountered using Sharp module 
- New Leaderboard commands!!
---
## **Features**
- Detects and processes messages from myuu(`id: 438057969251254293`).
- Recognizes PokÃ©mon like "Shiny" and "Greninja-Ash" and performs actions such as:
  - Timing out users for a short duration.
  - Sending embeds with encounter details in the same channel.
  - Logging these encounters in designated channels.
- Slash commands for retrieving bot and server information:
  - `/ping` - Check the bot's ping and system information.
  - `/botinfo` - Get detailed information about the bot.
  - `/serverinfo` - Retrieve details about the current server.
  - `/can_timeout` - Check if the bot can time out a specific user.
  - `/leaderboard server`- Shows the shiny leaderboard of the server
  - `/leaderboard cleardata`- Deletes the data of shinys encountered in a server.
  - `/shiny add <user> <amount of shinys>`- Adds particular no. of shinys found in the server.
  - `/shiny remove <user> <amount>`- Removes particular no. of shinys found in the server. 
  - `/botban <user> ` - Refrains a user to use the bot commands.
  - `/removebotban <user>` - Removes the bot ban of a user.
  - `/info <user>` - Shows Custom Pokemon Timeout list!
  - `/timeoutpokemon add <pokemon>` - Adds the pokemon in timeout list (Will timeout you when encountered)!
  - `/timeoutpokemon remove <slot no.>` - Removes the pokemon from the timeout list!
  - `/routecount` - Shows your routecount! (It will reset if a shiny is found)
  - New auction commands added too ðŸ˜‰! (Took me a lot of time to complete)

# **Known-Issues**

- Rate limits are not handled.
- Some functions deprecated in Discord.js v14 are still present in the bot. As a result, certain commands might stop working in the future due to this.
- Embed-based `mypkinfo` is not implemented for auctions.  
- Some bugs exist, such as:
  - If the channel of an existing auction is deleted, the bot crashes. (A `catch` block needs to be added to handle this. You can contribute to fix this.)  
  - Need to add catchblocks somewhere so the bot dont crash.
