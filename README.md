# **FrostyBot: A multipurpose Discord Bot for FrostyCord**

ForstyBot is a feature-packed Discord bot originally designed for **FrostyCord** but now upgraded with a variety of useful functions, ranging from PokÃ©mon encounter logging to content downloading from YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and TikTok. Plus, it brings some fun to your server with Markov Chains to generate random, humorous sentences.

# **Whats-New**
- **Multipurpose Bot**: Expanded to support social media content downloading (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and TikTok).
- **Markov Chain Fun**: Generates random funny sentences based on chat input.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Tracks shiny PokÃ©mon encounters in a database.
- **Reworked File Structure**: Optimized the bot's file structure for better performance.
- **New Slash Commands**: Includes new downloader and fun commands.

# **Known-Issues**

- Rate limits are not handled.
- Some functions deprecated in Discord.js v14 are still present in the bot. As a result, certain commands might stop working in the future due to this.
- Embed-based `mypkinfo` is not implemented for auctions.  
- Some bugs exist, such as:
  - If the channel of an existing auction is deleted, the bot crashes. (A `catch` block needs to be added to handle this. You can contribute to fix this.)  
  - Need to add catchblocks somewhere so the bot dont crash.
- The YouTube Shorts downloader breaks frequently when the code is hosted on a non-residential instance , so I use TOR proxy, though its slow!
